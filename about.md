I am a System Software Engineer at ByteDance, focusing on Java workload optimization.

Prior to joining ByteDance, I spent two years at [Alibaba Infrastructure](https://www.alibabacloud.com/). I hold a Master's degree from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Lei Ju](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/julei).
